                        A mostly-complete implementation of the Molang expression language from Minecraft in Rust. It is
                        used in
                        Minecraft
                        for programmable animations, however it could also be a great fit for other software such as
                        spreadsheets. It taught me a lot about how to parse and interpret language. See the <a
