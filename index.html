                    <h3>Molang</h3>
                    <p>

                        A mostly-complete implementation of the Molang expression language from Minecraft in Rust. It is
                        used in
                        Minecraft
                        for programmable animations, however it could also be a great fit for other software such as
                        spreadsheets. It taught me a lot about how to parse and interpret language. See the <a
                            href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/molangreference/?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable">Microsoft
                            docs</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/fmccl/Molang">source code</a>.
